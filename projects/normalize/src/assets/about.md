## About Normalizi.ng

Normalizi.ng is an experimental online research in machine-learning that aims to analyze and understand how do we decide who looks more “normal”. Mobile visitors to the Normalizi.ng website are presented with a series of previously recorded participants. They then choose who looks more “normal” between pairs of noses, mouths, eyes, and faces. The machine analyzes their decisions and adds them to it’s algorithmic map of normality.

In the late 1800s the French forensics pioneer Alphonse Bertillon, the father of the mugshot, developed “Le Portrait Parle” (the speaking portrait) a system for standardizing, indexing and classifying the human face. His statistical system was never meant to criminalize the face but it was later widely adopted by both the Eugenics movement and by the Nazis to do exactly that.

The online work automates Bertillon’s speaking portraits and visualizes how today’s systematic discrimination is aggregated, amplified and conveniently hidden behind the seemingly objective black box of Artificial Intelligence.

Mushon Zer-Aviv is a designer, researcher, educator and media activist based in Tel Aviv. His love/hate relationship with data informs his design work, art pieces, activism, research, teaching, workshops & city life. His current research reimagines the role of friction in technology, media, design and politics. Among Mushon’s collaborations, he is the CO-founder of Shual.com – a foxy design studio; and multiple government transparency and civic participation initiatives with the Public Knowledge Workshop; Mushon also designed the maps for Waze.com and led the design of Localize.city. Mushon is an alumni of Eyebeam art + technology center in New York. He is a senior faculty member at Shenkar College and has previously he taught at NYU, Parsons, and Bezalel.

The code for the work was developed by Adam Kariv and is available on Github.

The work was commissioned by Science Gallery Dublin. Thank you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

This work takes a critical perspective on data, privacy, surveillance and algorithms, it is therefore extra considerate about privacy issues. I tried to make everything as comprehensive as possible. It is hence written in an FAQ format:

### What data do you collect?

Normalizi.ng actually knows very little about you and we would like to keep it this way. If you allow us, we do save data on your device to associate your profile and image with you.
