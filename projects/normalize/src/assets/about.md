## About Normalizi.ng

**Normalizi.ng** is an experimental online research in machine-learning that aims to analyze and understand how do we decide who looks more “normal”. When you visit www.Normalizi.ng on your phone you will be asked to take a selfie and then be presented with a series of previously recorded participants. You will then choose who looks more “normal” between pairs of noses, mouths, eyes, and faces. The machine will analyze your decisions and your face and then add you to it’s algorithmic map of normality.

In the late 1800s the French forensics pioneer Alphonse Bertillon, the father of the mugshot, developed “Le Portrait Parle” (the speaking portrait) a system for standardizing, indexing and classifying the human face. His statistical system was never meant to criminalize the face but it was later widely adopted by both the Eugenics movement and by the Nazis to do exactly that.

The online work automates Bertillon’s speaking portraits and visualizes how today’s systematic discrimination is aggregated, amplified and conveniently hidden behind the seemingly objective black box of Artificial Intelligence.

**Mushon Zer-Aviv** is a designer, researcher, educator and media activist based in Tel Aviv. His love/hate relationship with data informs his design work, art pieces, activism, research, teaching, workshops & city life. His current research reimagines the role of friction in technology, media, design and politics. Among Mushon’s collaborations, he is the CO-founder of Shual.com – a foxy design studio; and multiple government transparency and civic participation initiatives with the Public Knowledge Workshop; Mushon also designed the maps for Waze.com and led the design of Localize.city. Mushon is an alumni of Eyebeam art + technology center in New York. He is a senior faculty member at Shenkar College and has previously he taught at NYU, Parsons, and Bezalel.

The code for the work was developed by **Adam Kariv** and is available on Github.

The work was generously commissioned by **Science Gallery at Trinity College Dublin as part of BIAS 2021 and European ARTificial Intelligence Lab.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

This work takes a critical perspective on data, privacy, surveillance and algorithms, it is therefore extra considerate about privacy issues. I tried to make everything as comprehensive as possible. It is hence written in an FAQ format:

### What data do you collect?

Normalizi.ng actually knows very little about you and I would like to keep it this way. If you permit it, the site saves data on your device to associate your profile and image with you.

### What do you do with the data?

The work saves a session per each participant including: images, swipes, location and the time of day. Based on that it generates dynamic normalization scores and the map of faces.
      
The data is only used for this work and there are no 3rd parties with access to it whatsoever. I may use some screenshots and videos for the work’s documentation though.
      
Read more in the [privacy policy](#).

### How do I find my face here?

After you finish the normalizing interaction a face icon appears on the top right corner of the screen. Tap it to focus on your own face.

### How can I delete my data?

Open your card and at the bottom you will find a button to delete your data. Tap it and follow the instructions.

### Will you really delete all of my data?

Yes, it may take me up to 24 hours to clear any proof you ever existed (on our site at least). But yes, including server and IP logs.

If you have any concern please email: me @ normalizi.ng

### Can I use the data from this site?

No.
