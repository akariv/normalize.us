## About Normalizi.ng

**Normalizi.ng** is an experimental online research in machine-learning that aims to analyze and understand how do we decide who looks more “normal”. When you visit www.Normalizi.ng on your phone you will be asked to take a selfie and then be presented with a series of previously recorded participants. You will then choose who looks more “normal” between pairs of noses, mouths, eyes, and faces. The machine will analyze your decisions and your face and then add you to it’s algorithmic map of normality.

In the late 1800s the French forensics pioneer Alphonse Bertillon, the father of the mugshot, developed “Le Portrait Parle” (the speaking portrait) a system for standardizing, indexing and classifying the human face. His statistical system was never meant to criminalize the face but it was later widely adopted by both the Eugenics movement and by the Nazis to do exactly that.

The online work automates Bertillon’s speaking portraits and visualizes how today’s systematic discrimination is aggregated, amplified and conveniently hidden behind the seemingly objective black box of Artificial Intelligence.

## Frequently Asked Questions

This work takes a critical perspective on data, privacy, surveillance and algorithms, it is therefore extra considerate about privacy issues. I tried to make everything as comprehensive as possible. It is hence written in an FAQ format:

### What data do you collect?

Normalizi.ng actually knows very little about you and I would like to keep it this way. If you permit it, the site saves data on your device to associate your profile and image with you.

### What do you do with the data?

The work saves a session per each participant including: images, swipes, location and the time of day. Based on that it generates dynamic normalization scores and the map of faces.
      
The data is only used for this work and there are no 3rd parties with access to it whatsoever. I may use some screenshots and videos for the work’s documentation though.
      
Read more in the [privacy policy](#privacypolicy).

### How do I find my face here?

After you finish the normalizing interaction a face icon appears on the top right corner of the screen. Tap it to focus on your own face.

### How can I delete my data?

Open your card and at the bottom you will find a button to delete your data. Tap it and follow the instructions.

### Will you really delete all of my data?

Yes, it may take me up to 24 hours to clear any proof you ever existed (on our site at least). But yes, including server and IP logs.

If you have any concern please email: me @ normalizi.ng

### Can I use the data from this site?

No.

## Privacy Policy

Hello. My name is Mushon Zer-Aviv and I am responsible for Normalizi.ng. Here is how I protect your data and respect your privacy.

### My role in your privacy

If you are visiting or participating in the Normalizi.ng experience, this policy applies to you.

#### My responsibilities

I act as the "[data controller](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controller-processor/what-data-controller-or-data-processor_en)" of any personal data. This means I determine how and why your data are processed.

#### Your responsibilities

- Read this Privacy Policy
- If you provide me with personal information about other people, or if
others give me your information, I will only use that information for
the specific reason for which it was provided to me. By submitting the
information, you confirm that you have the right to authorise me to
process it on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### When and how I collect data

If you are only a visitor to our website, please know that I do not collect any personal data before you participate in the [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) experience that starts with the button "start".

From the moment you start the [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) experience, I collect only the data you explicitly provide me.

Here’s the data you will create and share with me and why:

#### Selfies

##### a moving selfie picture made from a set of 5 images

The moving selfie will be added to a map of faces and analyzed algorithmically. It will also be presented to other users to normalize - compare to other participants selfies.

#### Normalizations

##### a set of answers to questions comparing pairs of images (who looks more normal?)

Your answers will be used to set the normalization scores of other participants and to analyze your own choice patterns.

#### Location

##### Your GPS location as detected by the browser

By using location data I will be able to create location specific maps and normalization scores.

patterns.

#### Email (optional)

##### Your email address

I will only use your email once to send you a personal link so you can always edit or delete your data at any time.


*Additionally, please consider that screenshots of the work for media purposes may include your face and be presented in other contexts outside of normalizi.ng.

#### What else do you know about me?

The face detection algorithm I use will attempt to identify your age and gender, but it will be nothing but a guess based on your image.

I don’t collect any "sensitive data" about you (like racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious/philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health data, data about your sexual life or orientation, and offences or alleged offences). 

#### What about children’s data?

[Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) is a provocative experience directed to and intended for use only by those who are 18 years of age or over. I do not target Normalizi.ng at children. If you decide to expose your children to Normalizi.ng, I recommend you have a conversation with them and explain the work to them as a provocation in the context of networked culture, race and algorithms.

### [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) is based on your consent, what does it mean?

You have given clear consent to process your personal data for your participation in Normalizi.ng.

#### You can change your mind!

If you have previously given consent to processing your data you can freely withdraw such consent at any time. On your phone you can do this by deleting your profile using the delete button on the bottom of your card. If you can't find it, use the link I emailed you. Otherwise, contact me and I will try to help.

If you do withdraw your consent, I will stop processing your personal data. This may take me up to 24 hours for technical reasons.

### Your Rights

You can exercise your rights by sending me an email at me @ normalizi.ng.

#### You have the right to access information we hold about you

This includes the right to ask us supplementary information about:

- The types of data I'm processing
- The purposes of data processing
- How long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period)
- Your other rights regarding our use of your data

I will provide you with the information within one month of your request, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other (e.g. another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights). I will tell you if I can’t meet your request for that reason.

#### You have the right to be "forgotten"

This is simply done by deleting your profile. If for some reason, you were not able to do that, please tell me first, so I have a chance to address your concerns. 

#### You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding my use of your data

#### How secure is the data I collect?

While I took careful procedures to safeguard and secure the information I collect.
