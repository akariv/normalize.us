Hello. My name is Mushon Zer-Aviv and I am responsible for Normalizi.ng. Here is how I protect your data and respect your privacy.

## My role in your privacy

If you are visiting or participating in the Normalizi.ng experience, this policy applies to you.

### My responsibilities

I act as the "[data controller](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controller-processor/what-data-controller-or-data-processor_en)" of any personal data. This means I determine how and why your data are processed.

### Your responsibilities

- Read this Privacy Policy
- If you provide me with personal information about other people, or if
others give me your information, I will only use that information for
the specific reason for which it was provided to me. By submitting the
information, you confirm that you have the right to authorise me to
process it on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## When and how I collect data

If you are only a visitor to our website, please know that I do not collect any personal data before you participate in the [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) experience that starts with the button "start".

From the moment you start the [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) experience, I collect only the data you explicitly provide me.

Here’s the data you will create and share with me and why:

### Selfies

**a moving selfie picture made from a set of 5 images**

The moving selfie will be added to a map of faces and analyzed algorithmically. It will also be presented to other users to normalize - compare to other participants selfies.

### Normalizations

**a set of answers to questions comparing pairs of images (who looks more normal?)**

Your answers will be used to set the normalization scores of other participants and to analyze your own choice patterns.

### Location

**Your GPS location as detected by the browser**

By using location data I will be able to create location specific maps and normalization scores.

patterns.

### Email (optional)

**Your email address**

I will only use your email once to send you a personal link so you can always edit or delete your data at any time.


*Additionally, please consider that screenshots of the work for media purposes may include your face and be presented in other contexts outside of normalizi.ng.

### What else do you know about me?

The face detection algorithm I use will attempt to identify your age and gender, but it will be nothing but a guess based on your image.

I don’t collect any "sensitive data" about you (like racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious/philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health data, data about your sexual life or orientation, and offences or alleged offences). 

### What about children’s data?

[Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) is a provocative experience directed to and intended for use only by those who are 18 years of age or over. I do not target Normalizi.ng at children. If you decide to expose your children to Normalizi.ng, I recommend you have a conversation with them and explain the work to them as a provocation in the context of networked culture, race and algorithms.

## [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) is based on your consent, what does it mean?

You have given clear consent to process your personal data for your participation in Normalizi.ng.

### You can change your mind!

If you have previously given consent to processing your data you can freely withdraw such consent at any time. On your phone you can do this by deleting your profile using the delete button on the bottom of your card. If you can't find it, use the link I emailed you. Otherwise, contact me and I will try to help.

If you do withdraw your consent, I will stop processing your personal data. This may take me up to 24 hours for technical reasons.

## Your Choices

If you choose to do this, you can continue to use the website and browse its pages, but I will not be able to give you the full [Normalizi.ng](http://normalizi.ng) experience without personal data.

## Your Rights

You can exercise your rights by sending me an email at me @ normalizi.ng.

### You have the right to access information we hold about you

This includes the right to ask us supplementary information about:

- The types of data I'm processing
- The purposes of data processing
- How long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period)
- Your other rights regarding our use of your data

I will provide you with the information within one month of your request, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other (e.g. another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights). I will tell you if I can’t meet your request for that reason.

### You have the right to be "forgotten"

This is simply done by deleting your profile. If for some reason, you were not able to do that, please tell me first, so I have a chance to address your concerns. If I fail in this, you can address any complaint to the CNIL, either by calling their helpline or as directed on their website at [https://www.cnil.fr/](https://www.cnil.fr/).

### You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding my use of your data

### How secure is the data I collect?

While I took careful procedures to safeguard and secure the information I collect.

**Please remember**:

- You provide personal data at your own risk: unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure
- You are responsible of your secret link: keep it secret and safe, otherwise someone may delete your profile on your behalf.
- If you believe your privacy has been breached, please contact me immediately on [me@normalizi.ng](mailto:me@normalizi.ng?subject=I%20believe%20my%20Privacy%20has%20been%20Breached)

### Where do I store the data?

The personal data I collect is primarily stored in ________________ servers in ________. 

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing by me. If I transfer or store your information outside the EEA in this way, I will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### How long do I store your data?

I will archive and stop actively using any personal identifiable information about you within 12 months from when it was created. I will delete your personal data from my archives no later than 36 months from when it was created or as agreed with you in a separate contract.

### Third parties who process your data

Tech businesses often use third parties to help them host their application, communicate with customers, power their emails etc. Normalizi.ng is not a tech business, and therefore simply doesn't do that. The only third parties I use are dedicated to the tech infrastructure and do not have legal rights to access the data.

Here are the details of our main third-party service providers, and what data they collect or we share with them, where they store the data and why they need it:
